# Hotel-Management-System-in-CPP
This project is a Hotel Management System enriched with the concepts of Objected Oriented Programming. It gives the relation between different classes and how they are interacting with each other and with the date and time. This project mainly uses the core concepts of OOP (Objected Orientated Programming). This also serves as a challenge for us to interlink time with classes. This documentation covers the concise design process of the code, simulations in order to verify functionality, and an effective project which is successfully implemented.
